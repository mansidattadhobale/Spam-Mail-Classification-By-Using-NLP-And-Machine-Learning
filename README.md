By analyzing the textual content of emails, the model tries to identify spam-related patterns and keywords. The project involves data preprocessing and feature extraction via TF-IDF or word embeddings along with the development of a classification model using Naive Bayes, SVM, or neural networks.

The overall aim is to refine email filtering systems to make them more efficient in detecting unwanted or threatening emails with few false positives. This solution will be scalable, adaptable, and integral to cybersecurity and digital communication management.
